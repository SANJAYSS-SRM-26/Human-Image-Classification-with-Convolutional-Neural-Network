# Human-Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Network
  This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify images as humans.The project includes code for downloading the dataset, building and training the CNN model, and visualizing             intermediate representations. It's an educational project suitable for beginners looking to understand image classification using deep learning.

# Requirements
  Python 3.x | 
  TensorFlow 2.x |
  Matplotlib | 
  Numpy | 
  Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the notebook)
